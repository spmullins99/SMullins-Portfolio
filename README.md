# [Clustering and Regression Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/spmullins99/ML-Algorithms)
This report exemplifies procedures relating to both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques
on both real and simulated datasets. Hyperparameter tuning to achieve improved prediction and clustering
performance is the main focus. Hierarchical clustering, k-means, kernel k-means, Lasso regression, random forests 
and Gaussian processes are implemented in Python using GridsearchCV, and their characteristics discussed, in this 18 page report. 
Variable importance, PCA, nested cross-validation and other essential ideas are also dealt with in the context of
the data.
